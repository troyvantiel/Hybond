            Residual Dipolar coupling (RDC) module


Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) is an orientational restraint offering 
information about the average orientation of an internuclear vector formed 
by two NMR active nuclei with respect to the static magnetic field. This 
module allows the user to restrain RDC during the NMR structure calculation.

                      Details of RDC commands

1   NSET    Number of alignment media from which RDCs are collected; Default 1.
2   MAXRDC  Maximum number of RDC restraints; Default 1000.
3   SRDC    Normalizes (scales) the given RDCs with respect to NH RDC.
4   KHAR    Force constant for harmonic restraint; Default 1.
5   LHAR    Length of the harmonic function; Default 1.
6   KASY    Force constant for the soft asymptotic potential; Default 1.
7   EXPO    Exponential function for soft asymptote; Default 1.
8   QRMF    Define molecular frame only using RDC atoms. 
9   QFIXA   Fix the alignment tensor.
10  QFIXB   Fix all the RDC bonds.
11  SLOW    RDC full force calculation.
12  URDC    Unit number of the file from which the RDC data should be read.
13  XPLO    XPLOR format RDC input; Default format: CHARMM.
14  BMRB    BMRB format RDC input; Default format: CHARMM.
15  ANAL    Gives detailed analysis of observed versus calculated RDCs. 
16  BCAL    Given one type of RDC, for instance HN-H, does the back calculation
            of RDCs like CA-HA, C-CA etc using the alignment tensor derived 
            using HN-N RDC. Requires atoms involved in RDC back calculation.
            If the URDC is specified, the output will be stored in a separate 
            file that has a URDC number as the suffix and prefix as 'fort'.
            If URDC is not specified, the analysis will be displayed in the
            CHARMM output file itself. RRES indicates the starting residue
            number. Note that back calculation of RDC will not work for
            methylene RDCs.
17  RESET   Resets all assignments of the RDC module.

                       Examples for RDC restraints



1)  Example for reading BMRB format RDC restraints from a file named
    data/ubi_rdc.bmrb measured in a single alignment media and restraining
    it with soft asymptotic potential parameters KHAR=0.5, KASY=0.5, LHAR=5
    and EXPO=1

2)  Example for reading CHARMM format RDC restraints from files protg1.cmm1,
    protg1.cmm2, protg1.cmm3, protg1.cmm4 and protg1.cmm5 measured in five 
    alignment media and restraining it with soft asymptotic potential
    parameters KHAR=0.5, KASY=0.5, LHAR=5 and EXPO=1. Different soft asymptotic
    potential parameters can be used for different RDCs in the CHAMM format.

    the molecular frame with respect to the RDC only atoms.

4)  Example for analyzing observed vs calculated RDCs. If the URDC is
    specified, the output will be stored in a separate file that has a URDC
    number as the suffix and prefix as ".fort". If URDC is not specified,
    the analysis will be displayed in the CHARMM output file itself.

To have the analysis details in CHARMM output:

RDC ANAL

5)  Example for back calculating RDC from multiple alignment media

To have the analysis details in CHARMM output:

To have the analysis details in CHARMM output, but, with residue number
starting from 20:
