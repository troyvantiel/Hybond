Distance Correlation (DCOR)

Distance correlation coefficient is a very useful and elegant alternative to the standard measures 
of correlation and is based on several deep and non-trivial theoretical calculations developed by 
Székely, Rizzo and Bakirov [1].  The main result is that a single, simple statistic DCOR(X,Y) can 
be used to assess whether two random vectors X and Y, of possibly different respective dimensions, 
are dependent, linearly or non-linearly, based on an independent and identically distributed 
(i.i.d.) sample.

DCOR Commands

DCOR can be invoked from CORREL using the keyword DCOR to calculate dependence between two time 
series, which can be of different respective dimensions. Time series can contain any variable. The 
only requirement is both the time series should be of equal length.

setup trajectory file

correl maxt ... maxa ... maxs …
  setup first time series
  setup second time series
  traj trajectory sepcifications
  dcor time-series1 time-series2
end

DCOR can also be invoked from CORMAN as a part of “COORdinate COVAariance”, using the keyword DCOR 
(DCOV), to calculate distance correlation (covariance) between positional fluctuation of two 
selection of atoms. 


COORdinates COVAriance traj-spec 2x(atom_selection) [UNIT_for_output int] -
                       [RESIdue_average_nsets integer] [MATRix] -
                       [ENTRopy [TEMP <real>] [DIAG] [RESI] [SCHL] ]-
                       [DCOR] [DCOV]

If DCOR or DCOV has been requested with ENTRopy, ENTRopy command will be ignored. If both DCOR and 
DCOV have been requested, then DCOR will be ignored.


Parallel:
When using CORREL parallelization in calculating distance correlations can be achieved by submitting 
multiple serial jobs. Using COORdinate COVAriance distance correlations between positional 
fluctuations of multiple atoms can be calculated using parallel version of CHARMM.

    16                  93.9        15.37          96%  

For better parallelization of DCOR using COORdinate COVAriance, select the larger number of atoms using 
the second selection. Time requirement for DCOR calculation between two time series increases as N*N 
where N is the length of the time series.

Introduction to Distance Correlation

Among Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), a generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) 16 and 
distance correlation coefficient (DCOR), DCOR is the most appropriate parameter to find association 
in atomic motions because it is least sensitive to angular dependence while reflecting variability in
covariance. [2] Calculation of DCOR between two vector series is straightforward to implement. Let {A} 
and {B} be two vector series with m entries each and the ith entry in {A} is denoted by A_i . To 
calculate distance covariance between {A} and {B} the following five steps are needed.

1) Calculate the m x m matrix, a, from {A}, where a_ij is the Euclidean distance between the ith
and jth entries of {A}: a_ij = a_ji =| A i − A j |
2)  Average the rows of a: a_i. = 1/m sum_j(a_ij)
3)  Average the columns of a: a_.j = 1/m sum_i(a_ij)
4) Average all elements of a: a_.. = 1/(m*m) sum_ij(a_ij)
5) Build the m x m matrix alpha from a where alpha_ij = a_ij − a_i. − a_. j + a_..

Then the distance covariance is
DCOV(A, B) ≡ sqrt(1/(m*m) sum_ij(alpha_ij * beta_ij))
where beta_ij is defined similarly from B.

The distance correlation coefficient, DCOR, is defined as
DCOR = DCOV(A,B)/sqrt(DCOV(A,A) * DCOV (B,B))

DCOR was found to capture both linear and non-linear correlation between positional vectors [2] and 
was able to reveal long-distance concerted motions in a protein that was not revealed by PCC or GCC. [2]

Input File

1) CORREL input for DCOR between positional fluctuation between 2 CA atoms:
