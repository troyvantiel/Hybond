set length = 10.0
set radius = 1.0

!parameters don't need to be declared first
!set area   = 0.0
!set volume = 0.0
!set crazy  = 0.0

calc area   = @radius * ?pi **2
calc volume = @length * @area 
calc crazy  = cos(37.25* ?pi /360)*exp(-@volume/100.0)

! Notice that the ?parameters can be used directly but MUST be surrounded
! by blanks
! for example, 
calc crazy  = ?pi
! works, but
calc crazy  = ?pi**2
! does not...
