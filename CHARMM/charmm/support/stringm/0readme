===================

This directory contains MATLAB / GNU Octave scripts that may be useful
for postprocessing data produced by string method calculations.

There are three flavors of the string method (see documentation):
sm0k/zts, ftsm, and smcv/colvar.  Subdirectories corespond to these
methods. Scripts that should be applicable to all methods are in this
directory.

The files are provided in the hopes that thay will be useful, and with
the understanding that they should require customization/fine tuning to
produce desired graphs, etc, but with no warranties.

The scripts are accompanied by example data generated by the test cases
in c40test (see test)

Matlab/Octave file listing:
==========================


arc.m : plot string length
rmsd.m : plot rmsd between evolving string and initial string
smooth2.m : optional smoothing routine
vcalc.m : compute and plot free energy and mean first passage time from voronoi logs
voro_fe.m : compute and plot free energy using collision data from voronoi simulations
ftsm/free.m : compute free energy from ftsm simulation data
sm0k/ener.n : plot potential energies along zero-temperature string in sm0k data 
smcv/free.m : plot free energy output from SMCV simulations
