PATH
=========

One short sentence that briefly describes the purpose and functionaly of the command,
followed by an outline of the documentation contained in this file.


**Outline:**

  * :ref:`ref-cmd-path-cite`
  * :ref:`ref-cmd-path-syntax`
  * :ref:`ref-cmd-path-misc`
  * :ref:`ref-cmd-path-warnings`
  * :ref:`ref-cmd-path-examples`

References to Cite
------------------

Developers: Add any pertinent citations to bib.rst, and link to them here.
When publishing results obtained using the PATH command in CHARMM, please
include the following literature citations:

  * Citation 1
  * Citation 2

.. _ref-cmd-path-syntax:

Syntax
------

Precise syntax description of the command, subcommands, keywords and
arguments. This section should be dry and technical. It should include a full
listing of the command, subcommands, etc. Their data types, their default
values and links to descriptions therof. For example if a command takes an
atom-spec as an argument, it should describe this, and then link to the
atom-spec documentation. The atom-spec should not be described again here. If
new specs are required for this command, they should be defined here and given
appropriate markup so other documents may link to them as necesary.  See
:ref:`ref-cmd-nbon` for an example of how to fill this in.

.. _ref-cmd-path-misc:

Miscellaneous Information
-------------------------

Information that is generally applicable to all subcommands and keywords for
this documented functionality. This might include unit conventions.

.. _ref-cmd-path-warnings:

Warnings
--------

.. warning::
    This document has not been updated yet!  Somebody needs to work on it.

Non-standard CHARMM behavior should be described here, or details of the
command that have been known to cause confusion for users. Also, known bugs
should also be described here.

.. _ref-cmd-path-examples:

Examples
--------

Brief snippets of input script commands should be given here using reasonable
values. For each command snippet a very brief description of what the command
is doing should also be given. The purpose of this section isn't to give a full
tutorial, or even to broadly describe "best practices", instead terse, to the
point, examples are prefered in this context.
