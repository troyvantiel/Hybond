Obtaining Coordinates
=====================

Obtaining coordinates from the PDB
----------------------------------

The pdb is excellent.

Using internal coordinates in the RTF
-------------------------------------

Sometimes you don't need to bother with the PDB though, CHARMM already knows
the coordinates of many small ligands.

Filling missing coordinates
---------------------------

Sometimes you will have atoms in your model with no unknown coordinates, CHARMM
can intelligently guess what they should be by also using the internal
coordinates facility.

Writing your own CRD files
--------------------------

Is a great way to import coordinates from various QM packages.

Coordinate Manipulation
-----------------------

The `coor` command is baller.
