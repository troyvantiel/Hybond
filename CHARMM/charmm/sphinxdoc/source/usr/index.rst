This was listed as *Nuts and Bolts* at the CHARMM mini-meeting.

How do I actually get CHARMM to do real science? For example:
  * What is the best way (or a reasonable way) to run NVT dynamics?
  * How can I calculate the free energy of solvation for my small ligand using HBAR?
  * What are the priciple components of my protein?
