POINTER DATABASE KEYS:
the columns in the pointer databases are labeled as follows:
1)  number           -- the number assigned to the pointer (serially starting from first file, alphabetically)
2)  pointer name     -- name of pointer 
3)  type fx          -- IREAL8, INTEG4, ILOGI4, or IREAL4
4)  allocated in file-- file in which pointer is used to do allocation in ALLHP or ALLSTK
5)  allocated in proc-- procedure in which pointer is used to do allocation
6)  declared in      --file in which pointer is declared (LOCALDECL means in same file as above)
7)  type             --type of array associated with pointer, as per the procedure database, DEFAULT0 means was not found either locally or globally,
                   MULTISUB means the variable was found in multiple subroutines, so typing not done.
8)  times loc used   --the number of times the pointer is used in a call, in the same subroutine in which it was used for allocation
9)  last loc use call--the last local procedure call in which the pointer was used
10)  glb type         --the type of array as determined by a global search of the pointer in the all calls.  MULTITYPE means it had more
                      than one type of associated array--i.e. probably an error in the CHARMM code (only 2 instances),  DEFAULT1 means not found in
                      global search.
11)  tmes usd glob    --the number of times the pointer was found in calls in a global search
12)  last glb use     --the call in which the pointer was last used
13)  loc type         --the type of the pointer as determined only by examination of the local calls (same subroutine as allocation)

the stack pointer db has only the first 9 columns.

PROCEDURE DATABASE KEYS:
1) file number
2) file name
3) number of procedure in current file
4) subroutine (S) or function (F)
5) name of procedure (subroutine or function)
6) number of argument in entire database
7) number of argument in file
8) number of argument in subroutine
9) name of argument 
10) type of argument, as declared in the subroutine
11) number of times the argument was found to be declared in the subroutine
   (0 if not found, 2 often if INTEGER8/INTEGER4 double declaration, a few are 3
    or more--some of these are script errors).
